JaeNDC is Just An Essential ND Calculator, calculating for exposure times with ND Filter.

When you use ND Filters in photography, JaeNDC can help you to calculate how you need to adapt exposure times. An ND Filter is a neutral density filter which you put in front of your lens and which removes light from the lightpath into the camera in order to allow for longer exposure times.

In JaeNDC you select your ND Filter and the "normal" exposure that the scene would take without ND Filter (which you may have measured with the camera or with an external light meter), and the app will calculate for you how long the exposure time should be with the ND Filter.

- You can optionally select a single or multiple ND Filters.
- You can add/edit/delete filters to match your personal filter collection (feature not available when running on old Android 2.x devices).
- When calculated exposure time is four seconds or more, you can also start a timer for the exposure which will notify you when the calculated time is over, even when the app has been closed meanwhile.

JaeNDC is modeled after Boris Nienke's popular NDCalc2 app for iOS; this JaeNDC Android app is actually a nice exercise in Android app development for me. Meanwhile some suggestions and extras have been implemented into JaeNDC, which make it a bit different from its original design and its original idol.

This app also plays well with tablets, tested on several different simulated and real devices with different large screen sizes.
